# Foodprint3D
Foodprint3D is a conceptual mobile interface design project centered around building a community of users that share their designs of 3D printed food.  The app allows the users to browse publicly shared designs and print them.  The user can also store and manage their own designs as well as share their designs with others for printing.  Users are also able to send messages to each other.

A prototype of this design can be found at:

Concepts used in this project:
1) Brainstorming for ideas.
2) Hand sketching for quick communication of ideas.
3) Establishment of a meaningful framework to define the purpose and strategy of the app.
4) Gathering of user feedback in order to improve user experience.
5) Generation of refined sketchs for use in preliminary user testing.
6) Generation of visual design to give the app a more final look and feel.
7) Generation of a prototype to obtain feedback from users/stakeholders.
