# UCSC-Mobile-Interface-Foodprint3D
A conceptual mobile interface design for a 3D foodprinting platform.

This is a conceptual mobile interface design project centered around building a community of users that share their designs of 3D printed food.  The app allows the users browse publicy shared designs that are printable.  The user can also store and manage their own designs as well as share their designs with others for printing.  Users are also able to send messages to each other.
